A simple flashcard website to practice the most common characters in Chinese. Each flashcard has the Chinese character, associated pinyin, and its English meaning on the other side. The website provides 10 sample Chinese characters when pressing "Load Sample Set." I have provided a JSON file consisting ~200 more Chinese Characters. To use, download the file and on the website, click "Choose File" at the bottom of the page. This will import all ~200 additional Chinese Characters as flashcards.
